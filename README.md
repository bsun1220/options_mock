# options_mock
In options mock, you are role-playing as a pit trader in the options exchanges who must react to broker flow in real time. This exercise enables you to practice a) understanding the fundamentals of options trading b) reacting to the flow and c) trading based off of the flow. From understanding what the market is doing, you can pick off stale quotes in the market and profit as well. 

This project enables people to practice options mock by generating options boards with random volatility, time-to-expiry, and stock price. An options board includes 5 strikes with the calls and puts. Each options board comes with combos (or combo markets) that can be combined to get the actual fair values of the options. There is additionally a 2 expiry version as well for those who want to practice options mock with multiple experies. Additional features include 1) the ability to export an excel doc with the options board and answer key and 2) a function that generates random customer orders.
